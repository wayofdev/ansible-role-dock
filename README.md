# Ansible Role: macOS Dock Automation

Role is used to automate use of [dockutil](https://github.com/kcrawford/dockutil) â€“ command line tool for managing dock items. You can add, remove and re-arrange Dock items.

### Why to use this role?

* This version supports latest 3.x 'dockutil
* Items are added, positioned and removed in single command run instead of loops
* Latest MacOS Monterey support
* Can purge all items contained in Dock with one setting
* No need for ansible handlers and sudo rights to do killall and restart Dock, as it is handled by `dockutil` by itself!


## Requirements

  - **Homebrew**: Requires `homebrew` already installed (you can use `geerlingguy.mac.homebrew` to install it on your Mac).

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with example values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

```
